**TITEL**
BIN-EXT-NOP-A-L-Y-1 (Software/Tests Example)

**DESCRIPTION**
Example of a consistency problem of linked models. 
A linked model with a relation (constraint) is evolved into another linked model by changing both parts.
Consistency problems may arise within the model and in between its evolutions.
In particular, we evolve the software and the testsuite independently. 
The new software parts correspond with no tests in the testsuite.
