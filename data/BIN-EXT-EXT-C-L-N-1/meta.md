**TITEL**
BIN-EXT-NOP-A-L-Y-1 (Car Model/Prototype Example)

**DESCRIPTION**
Example of a consistency problem of linked models. 
A linked model with a relation (constraint) is evolved into another linked model by changing one of its parts.
Consistency problems may arise within the model and in between its evolutions.
One model defines the building plan of a prototype.
Both models evolve and do no langer match each other isomorphically.
